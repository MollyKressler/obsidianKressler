**This document illustrates the workflow for the analyses in the aforementioned manuscript.** 

There are **7 .R files** which perform the analyses. There are *two support .R files* which include the code to run supplementary analyses, e.g. a sensitivity anlysis for setting a threshold to classify 'ghost' detections. 

The 7 .R files were written in Sublime Text, on a MacBook, using R version 4.2.0, and can be opened in R or R-Studio, or an alternative text editor, e.g. Visual Studio. 

The accompanying **data** for the analyses can be found in the folder '**data**'. For a description of the datasets please see the section in this document called 'Data Sets Described for Manuscript 'Habitat or safety? Drivers and management implications of juvenile lemon shark space use in mangrove nursery'. 

All the analyses can be performed using the six provided datasets if the code flow is followed through in its entirety.

Manuscript 'Habitat or safety? Drivers and management implications of juvenile lemon shark space use in mangrove nursery'

R code files can be found [https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms.git]. 

To run all analyses run the code files in this order: 
1. STEP1detectiondata_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R 
	https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms/blob/34fa126d62a6ce7eb77a48530e8eb176f9e9ff4a/STEP1detectiondata_KresslerTrevail_inprep.r
2. STEP2detectionranges_buffers_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R 
	https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms/blob/34fa126d62a6ce7eb77a48530e8eb176f9e9ff4a/STEP2detectionranges_buffers_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.r
3. STEP3habitathexagongrid_of_studysite_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
	https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms/blob/main/STEP3habitathexagongrid_of_studysite_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.r
4. STEP4pseudodetections_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
	https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms/blob/main/STEP4pseudodetections_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
5. STEP5modellingcode_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
	https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms/blob/main/STEP5modellingcode_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
6. STEP6evaluate_and_predict_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
	https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms/blob/main/STEP6evaluate_and_predict_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
7. STEP7_finalfigures.R
	https://github.com/MollyKressler/habitatorsafetylemonsharks_ms/blob/main/STEP7_finalfigures.R

Additionally, two supplementary R files are provided. 
1. determining_ghosts_hours_thresholds.R
2. justifying7pseudos_KresslerTrevailetal_inprep.R
These files perform analyses not crucial to the final results but nescessary for holistic interpretation of the choices made in data preparation and modelling.
