**This document illustrates the workflow for the anlyses in the manuscript titled *'Habitat or safety? Drivers and management implications of juvenile lemon shark space use in mangrove nursery'*** 

There are 7 .R files which perform the analyses. There are two support .R files which include the code to run supplementary analyses, e.g. a sensitivity anlysis for setting a threshold to classify 'ghost' detections. 

The 7 .R files were written in Sublime Text, on a MacBook, using R version 4.2.0. 

The accompanying data for the analyses can be found in the folder 'datasets'. For a description of the datasets please see the 'Data Sets Described for Manuscript 'Habitat or safety? Drivers and management implications of juvenile lemon shark space use in mangrove nursery'.md' file in the repo. 

All the analyses can be performed using the six provided datasets if the code flow is followed through in its entirety.
